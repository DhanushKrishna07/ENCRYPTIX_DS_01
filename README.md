Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether apassenger on the Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginnerproject with readily available data.

 🚢Titanic Survival Prediction🌊
 
I am thrilled to share my recent project where I delved into the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using logistic regression. This comprehensive analysis involved data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and model training. Here are the steps and insights from my project.🌊🚢🔍

Project Highlights:

•Cleaned data by handling missing values and dropping irrelevant columns.
•Conducted exploratory data analysis with visualizations.
•Encoded categorical variables.
•Trained a logistic regression model.
•Evaluated model accuracy on training and test data.

Steps Involved:

• Imported essential libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.
• Loaded the Titanic dataset and explored its structure and content.
• Identified and handled missing values by dropping the 'Cabin' column and filling missing 'Age' and 'Embarked' values.
• Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships within the data.
• Visualized key variables using bar plots, pie charts, histograms, KDE plots, and box plots.
• Encoded categorical columns such as 'Sex' and 'Embarked' for modeling purposes.
• Separated feature columns (X) and target column (Y) to prepare for model training.
• Split the data into training and test sets to evaluate model performance.
• Trained a logistic regression model to predict passenger survival.
• Evaluated the model's accuracy on both training and test data, achieving substantial accuracy scores.

Key Takeaway:

The logistic regression model effectively predicted the survival of Titanic passengers based on demographic and travel information. This project provided valuable insights into data preprocessing, visualization, and binary classification modeling. 🚀📊
